what if we run away
what if we left today
what if we said goodbye to safe and sound
what if we¡¯re hard to find
what if we lost our minds
what if we let them fall behind and they¡¯re never found
and when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
and the stars exploding we¡¯ll be fireproof

my youth
my youth is yours 
tripping on skies sipping waterfalls
my youth 
my youth is yours 
run away now and forevermore
my youth
my youth is yours
truth so loud you can¡¯t ignore
my youth
my youth
my youth
my youth is yours

what if we start to drive
what if we close our eyes
what if we¡¯re speeding through red lights into paradise
¡®cause we¡¯ve no time for getting old
mortal bodies timeless souls cross your fingers here we go
and when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
and the stars exploding we¡¯ll be fireproof

my youth 
my youth is yours 
tripping on skies sipping waterfalls
my youth 
my youth is yours 
run away now and forevermore
my youth 
my youth is yours
truth so loud you can¡¯t ignore
my youth 
my youth
my youth
my youth is yours

my youth is yours

my youth 
my youth is yours
tripping on skies sipping waterfalls
my youth
my youth is yours
run away now and forevermore
my youth
my youth is yours
truth so loud you can¡¯t ignore
my youth
my youth
my youth
my youth is yours

my youth is yours
my youth is yours
